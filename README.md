# Podcast Summarizer Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Podcast Summarizer project! This project allows you to transcribe podcast episodes and generate summaries based on their content. It uses the AssemblyAI and Listen Notes APIs for transcription and episode information retrieval.

## Project Structure

### 1. api_secrets.py

This file contains API keys required for communication with the AssemblyAI and Listen Notes APIs. Make sure to replace 'api_key_1' and 'api_key_2' with your actual API keys.

```python
# api_secrets.py

API_KEY_ASSEMBLYAI = 'your_assemblyai_api_key'
API_KEY_LISTENNOTES = 'your_listennotes_api_key'
```

### 2. api_communication.py

This module handles communication with the AssemblyAI and Listen Notes APIs. It includes functions for retrieving podcast episode information, transcribing audio, and polling for transcription completion.

```python
# api_communication.py

# ... (code for communication with APIs)
```

### 3. main.py

This script provides a Streamlit web interface for the Podcast Summarizer. Users can input an episode ID and download the episode summary. The summary includes chapter-wise information.

```python
# main.py

# ... (code for Streamlit web interface)
```
